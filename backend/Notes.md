## Frustating !!!! Today was the second day for the same issue I was stuck at .
>There was an issue in mongoDb connection it was giving me error :
"MongooseServerSelectionError: Could not connect to any servers in your MongoDB Atlas cluster."
>I thought there is an issue with my code and I was busting my ass to find it , i even created a new account , new cluster , but nothing seemed to work .
> I used chatGpt and gemini both were useless , giving me the solution i had already tried .

# Then came the saviour , Stack mfing overflow .
there was a user who mentioned that it was a common issue in the newer versions . so there it was . After 2 days..

"As of 2024 Oct, there seems to be a recent connection issue in Mongoose. The common symptom would be the same as the description in the question, throwing MongooseServerSelectionError despite having whitelisted the IPs.
>As mentioned in one of the comments under the issue, the mitigation would be downgrading mongoose from v8.7.0 to v8.5.2."
